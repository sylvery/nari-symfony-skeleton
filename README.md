# NARI Symfony Skeleton APP
I'll be using this skeleton app to bootstrap app development for Nari apps. Anyone can use it too.

All you have to do is to clone the repo, then run composer install and you're good to go.

It comes with a default controller which by default should load bootstrap4 and jquery+jquery-ui css and js libraries

Drop a like...or not :D
